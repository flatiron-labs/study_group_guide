# Study Group Guide

## Tl;Dr
* Pick a topic like a specific lab to review, topic you can provide AMA-style "office hours" on, small app you can build out live or small coding problem like a code kata to solve live.
* Go to [Learn.co](https://learn.co) and click the big green "create study group" button.
* Fill out the date, time, title, and zoom link.
* Put a reminder in the student slack channel ~20 before it starts.
* That's it!

# What is a Study Group

Study groups are provided to online students via group Zoom calls. They are created and hosted by students or teachers and can be on any topic. They are opportunities for students and teachers to work together to solve specific problems from a lab, ask and answer questions on a topic or share knowledge on a curriculum or curriculum-adjacent topic.

Study groups are a GREAT way to...
* Work directly with students and help them learn
* Work with and learn from our expert teachers
* Interact with Learn.co in all of its glory

# Picking a Topic
There are a few general categories for topics. Keep reading to learn more.

And/or check out the [TA lesson plans here](https://github.com/flatiron-labs/online-ed-ops/tree/master/technical-coach-team/role-learn-ta/lesson-plans) to get ideas for study groups. Feel free to take any of those lesson plans and use it to run your study group.

### Lab Review
When you click "create study group", there is a drop down menu in the form for you to choose any number of labs or lessons to review. Browse that menu and find one or two labs to use for your study group. Your study group can involve you solving the lab in a TDD fashion by running `learn` in the IDE and articulating your thought process, taking questions.

* Title your study group "Lab Review: The name of the lab"

### Curriculum Topic Office Hours/AMA
Pick a topic from the curriculum (again, the drop down menu described above will give you a sense of curriculum topics) and host office hours. This is an open format in which students can come with any questions on that topic. You can also pick a lab from that topic to review or have an idea for a small app or some code you can write together in case no one has specific questions.

* Title your study group "Office Hours: Sessions in Rails"

### Teacher's Choice
An introduction to/some info on a topic of your choosing. Want to talk about how to use Omniauth in Rails? How about JWT authentication? Or how you set up your amazing bash profile? Just keep the topics on a beginner level, prepare a few notes or some code you want to share/build out and run with it!

* Title your study group "Live Discussion: JWT Auth in Rails"

### Live Build
Pick a topic (Sinatra, JavaScript + DOM events, Rails routing) and build out a simple app or write some live code in an existing app or project that offers a closer look at the topic. For example, "Live Building: Rails Routing" could see you set up a new Rails app, define some routes and simple views and talk about how routing working in Rails.

* Title your study group: "Project Build: JavaScript Events + The DOM"

### Live Problem Solving
Show students how to use TDD and "thinking out loud" to solve a small code challenge. This can be framed as interview prep. Pick a code kata or, even better, a challenge from the [Flatiron Technical Interview Prep for Students repo](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/tips) to complete with your study group.

* Title your groups...whatever you want, there isn't a big precedent for these.

# Logistics

## Creating and Scheduling
* Create a scheduled Zoom meeting using your WeWork zoom account. When should you hold your study group? Literally any time! Online students have varied schedules, so whenever works for you is fine. 
* Visit Learn.co
* Click the big green "create a study group" button
* Fill out the form, including the Zoom link, and hit submit!

## Alerting/Reminding Students
* If you schedule your study group by Thursday of a given week, it will be included in a weekly roundup email students get outlining all upcoming study groups.
* ~20min before your study group starts, slack a reminder in the Learn.co Slack channels:
  * [online-web-developer](https://learn-co.slack.com/messages/G0B6FET6G/details/)
  * [online-web-sp](https://learn-co.slack.com/messages/CCXRW5UD6/details/)
* You can log into Learn.co slack by visiting the "connected app" section of your Learn profile and you can DM sophie.debenedetto to get invited to those channels.
